Note for Chris: the used autotrader doesn't have the headers, these must by copied over to from the 'new' file to work with the current setup.

Note for Me: The fucking CSV for used cars sucks. the fields didn't fill in correctly. fix this for the demo, but there has to be a better solution.

need a way to upload a picture and push the url into the image picture url array(might be a decent place to use angular verification)

how can we tell where the vehicle is?(off-lot or on)?  This can't be imported.  Should there be a way to insert just one vehicle at a time? If so we need a callback on the VIN validation to fire an update if the vehcile is being imported with more info later.

requires:

Must contain some sort of searching as well as filtering based on some criteria. Ex: All items in the "fruit" category, or all tasks past due:

Index needs this heavily.

Must contain at least one page that allows for dynamic updating of a single field of a resource. Ex: Allow changing of quantity in a shopping cart

????? probably would work for status.  Updating whether the car is on a test drive or it's location...ect


Links should work correctly. Ex: Clicking on a product in a list, should take you to the show page for that product:

not sure how but duh.


Data should be validated in Angular before submission:

this is just on like a form input angular will knwo if the data is in the correct format. the quesiton is where am i going to use a form?


Must talk to the Rails backend using $http and Services:

this is should just be calling to our DB in rails and getting JSON like the API jQuery stuff using angular.


5 pages:

Many of these pages may only be for the admin or manager. The fact is you cannot trust the user. this app is more for the manager to track the cars and the sales people. The sales people maybe only need to set and remove statuses and notes.

1) Inventory Index should split into use or new...there is a way to set a dropdown filter(there should be alot of drop down filters. This see all with sunroof, or see all in f and i))

2) Details/Show page/Notes?

3) Stats?  ---> running tally of how many of each particluar model ---> forecast vs percent sold to projected based on time... can i use the graphs visualizer?

4) swap page?  ---> other delearships inventory?(full or most wanted to trade)...if cannot gain access through ford. This maybe a participatory page. Where other using EZI can add what they want the network to see.

5) Admin/imports?/permissions?

6) calendar page?


Must contain some sort of nested views:

no clue



Plan:

sort thru inventory so that the sales consultant can tell what is 
in stock in that particular model and what is incoming in soon

where do we get the inventory? chris said he can get a CSV from an export service.
do we get the same on incoming cars? Can I get one for other dealerships? What do i need to get access to the ford API.


It has to recognize a car that is on hold in the business office and which sales person sent it there(color code: yellow for F and I?, red for sold, green for test drive?, plain for nothing. SOLD BUT NOT DELIVERED STAYS, DELIVERED GET REMOVED FROM THE DOM and moved into a purely achival list.) 
It has to tell the person what has been recently delivered and is no longer for sale 

It has to recognize if a car was in the yard or at the off site garage 

It should be able to tell if the car is on a test drive and which salesperson sent it there.

It has to sort by year make and model(angular?)

Need a note system as well.(put on same page with Invoice)


use a partial to render each car

Car Attrs: Year make model color MSRP and dealer invoice
Has many: options (equipment)
          statuses: FI, TD, On Lot, Sold, Delivered
          has_one: photo(paperclip)
          has_one: invoice(paperclip)
          should attached a sales person's name when that status is created. When status is resolved this association get deleted entirely(best solution?)
          i.e. status has_one user


Someday:

in a perfect world there'd be a map of the lot with exact locations.

Needs calendar and alert system to trigger when a car has been in a certain status for a set number of days




RAILS MODELS AND RELATIONSHIPS

Add attr to Vehicle: 
Location: either on-lot, off-lot, unset. default is unset.

Vehicles have many notes

Notes belong to an author and a Vehicle

Note: User.id, Vehicle.id, Content

Vehicles have many statuses

Statuses have a User.id as Status Setter and a Vehicle.id

Status types: Available, On Test Drive, In F and I, Sold, Delivered

Vehicles have one status. 

Available, On Test Drive, In F and I, Sold, Delivered
If status is to be set to another the current status will be deleted
(note should be created when status is created or changed)
any vehicle whose status is not Available or Delivered goes on the calendar
(when status is set to On Test Drive, In F and I, or Sold calender item is created
when status is set to Available or Delivered Calendar item is destroyed)





Users have many notes as authors through notes table
Users have many statuses as setters through status table (this will be used to populate the calendar)(note should be created when status is created)
