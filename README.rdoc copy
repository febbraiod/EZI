Do next:

since you have a notes branch on github, finish notes feature i.e. add delete for admins, maybe straighten up the layout a tad. get ride of any routesin the api you don't need. I think status is the next branch after that.

set up show page:

two tabs

details = {

  data is there need to get layout and photos working: and a link to the edit page for admins
  also shows vehicle's notes - need to add a delete note options for admins

  from the details w/notes tab there should be the option to set a new status or resolve and old one
  see notes. re: vehciles have one status. old status is destroyed when new one is set. note is added when any status is set or resolved. Status types: Available, On Test Drive, In F and I, Sold


}

invoice = { need to install paperclip }



edit vehicle page:

need adding and updating for vehicles for admin in case 
any cars come in with bad data or not at all

Data should be validated in Angular before submission:

look at all forms and input fields when done with functionality


add drop down filters.
one for each option:
Leather (lthr)
cloth.  
Navigation. (NAV)  
4x4 
4x2
statuses:
available, test drive, sold, fandi
price ranges?
mileages?


register is not working but i'd like to save this for the end.
this might help:

need to also include name in sign up form

or we could just do registration from the rails side


Note for Chris: the used autotrader doesn't have the headers, these must by copied over to from the 'new' file to work with the current setup.

Note for Me: The fucking CSV for used cars sucks. the fields didn't fill in correctly. fix this for the demo, but there has to be a better solution.


need a way to upload a picture and push the url into the image picture url array(might be a decent place to use angular verification)

how can we tell where the vehicle is?(off-lot or on)?  This can't be imported.  Should there be a way to insert just one vehicle at a time? If so we need a callback on the VIN validation to fire an update if the vehicle is being imported with more info later.



Many of these pages may only be for the admin or manager. The fact is you cannot trust the user. this app is more for the manager to track the cars and the sales people. The sales people maybe only need to set and remove statuses, make notes, and viww data, they are getting a personal calender as well.


6) calendar pages?

3) Stats?  ---> running tally of how many of each particluar model ---> forecast vs percent sold to projected based on time... can i use the graphs visualizer?

4) swap page?  ---> other delearships inventory?(full or most wanted to trade)...if cannot gain access through ford. This maybe a participatory page. Where other using EZI can add what they want the network to see.

5) Admin/imports?/permissions?

In the end the data should come from the parent Co. i.e. FMC FMCDEALER


It has to recognize a car that is on hold in the business office and which sales person sent it there(color code: yellow for F and I?, red for sold, green for test drive?, plain for nothing. SOLD BUT NOT DELIVERED STAYS, DELIVERED GET REMOVED FROM THE DOM and moved into a purely achival list.) 

It has to tell the person what has been recently delivered and is no longer for sale 

It has to recognize if a car was in the yard or at the off site garage 

It should be able to tell if the car is on a test drive and which salesperson sent it there.


in a perfect world there'd be a map of the lot with exact locations.

Needs calendar and alert system to trigger when a car has been in a certain status for a set number of days




RAILS MODELS AND RELATIONSHIPS

Add attr to Vehicle: 
Location: either on-lot, off-lot, unset. default is unset.


for delivered it will be a true false attr on vehicle.  This will delete any status(which should just be 'sold' then move the vehicle from index to delivered list)

Available, On Test Drive, In F and I, Sold
If status is to be set to another the current status will be deleted
(note should be created when status is created or changed)
any vehicle whose status is not Available or Delivered goes on the calendar
(when status is set to On Test Drive, In F and I, or Sold calender item is created
when status is set to Available or Delivered Calendar item is destroyed)

Users have many statuses as setters through status table (this will be used to populate the calendar!)(note should be created when status is created)
